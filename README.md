# LoginContract

This project accesses private variables stored in the Blockchain through deployment of Smart Contract. It uses Solidity as a programming language to build up SmartContract and hardhat framework to test and debug the same. In this project I have also used ethers.js library to access private data from the smartContract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
